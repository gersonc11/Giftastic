# Giftastic

This is a gif search web app I created using Bootstrap for styling and JQuery for DOM manipulation. It uses the Giphy API to retrieve gifs from the GIPHY database.

##Getting Started
To use the app just enter a word you would like to search for. If you want to look at any of the words you add just click the button with the search term that you entered.
